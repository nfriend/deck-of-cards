TODO
====

- upgrade to Bootstrap 3.3.7 if popover issue is resolved (currently on 3.3.4, and the popover animation isn't as nice)

- color button isn't clickable in Firefox - an element is covering it.

- add inner scrolling to Add Cards modal

- smarter image loading?  Currently, everything all card images are loaded on AddCardsViewModel instantiation

- What happens to chat messages once the player leaves disconnects?

- Change SVGs to PNGs - this will fix the strange resizing in Firefox

- Switch background from a background image to an actual THREE.js object (it should be the plane that's used for hit testing when dragging)
