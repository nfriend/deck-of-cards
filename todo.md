- bug in server that causes connection.player to not be populated - but only in firefox?
  Currently, messages send from Firefox -> Chrome, but not the other way around.
  Also some percularities with two incognito Chrome windows chatting (doesn't work).

- What happens to chat messages once the player leaves disconnects?
